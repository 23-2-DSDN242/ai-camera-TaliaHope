For this project, I decided to give a nod to the timeless charm of negative film photography while embracing modern digital tools. By capturing moments with friends and applying a filter that mimicked the aesthetic of negative film, I created a unique collage effect that highlighted the individuality of each person. I wanted to lean into popular film effect filter apps. 

When adjusting the HSB, I used the exmaple as inspiration to make it as realistic as possible. Navigating the adjustments of Hue, Saturation, and Brightness (HSB) parameters within this project, the provided images were pivotal guides for enhancing realism. Despite my personal leanings away from red, its role in the recognizable negative film aesthetic was undeniable. While I considered adding my own twist, I ultimately recognized the importance of retaining the iconic red hues for authenticity and flexibility in interpretation. Through careful manipulation of HSB settings, I aimed to strike a balance between honoring traditional negative film aesthetics and infusing the project with my own creative flair.

I have also provided an example of a blue version, I experimented with.
