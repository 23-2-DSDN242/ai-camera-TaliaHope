For this project, I wanted to try to recreate negative film photography. By capturing moments with friends and applying a filter that mimicked the aesthetic of negative film, I created a unique collage effect that highlighted the individuality of each person. I wanted to lean into popular film effect filter apps. 

When adjusting the HSB, I used the exmaple as inspiration to make it as realistic as possible. Navigating the adjustments of Hue, Saturation, and Brightness (HSB) parameters within this project, the provided images were pivotal guides for enhancing realism. Despite my personal dislike of red, its role in the recognizable negative film aesthetic was undeniable. While I considered adding my own twist, I ultimately recognized the importance of retaining the iconic red hues for authenticity and flexibility in interpretation. Through careful manipulation of HSB settings, I aimed to strike a balance between honoring traditional negative film aesthetics and infusing the project with my own creative flair. 

I have also provided an examples of ones I experimented with. The first experiment was a black and white background to give an old film look to it. I did further research and came across images that showed that the film was actually red. This led me to expriement with the hue to make it the right red. To experiment further, I wanted to try diffent colours and blue was one that stuk out to me.
